					h2 Who we are
			div.page-details-content
				p A dynamic and award-winning consultancy offering integrated planning and architectural services, PlanArch Design Ltd operates from offices converted in 1994 from a former terrace of cottages in the Bishop Auckland Conservation Area. 
				p We work regionally and nationally on planning and architectural schemes, with projects ranging from home extensions to major housing developments; designs for bespoke dwellings to work in the commercial, education and retail sectors; conversions and restoration of existing buildings, many with heritage credentials, as well as providing the full spectrum of planning consultancy services. 
				p This may be purely town planning advice regarding clientsâ€™ issues or negotiations with local planning authorities; an appeal against a refusal of planning permission; or seeking to make an existing use lawful.

			h2.text-center PlanArch Design are at the heart of the community
			p In providing our planning and architectural services, we have remained conscious of our place in the community. Thus we are employers of local people wherever possible, and we have a record over a considerable number of years of taking students from local schools on work placements and, on a regular basis, employing a school leaver to train him or her through college and university to gain the necessary appropriate qualifications to work in the industry and to take their careers forward.
			p We also sponsor, wherever appropriate, local initiatives and sports clubs, such as local football teams, as part of our role in the business community of Bishop Auckland.

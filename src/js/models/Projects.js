The scheme comprises a purpose built vehicle body repair shop fitted with anchored jigs and paint spray booths, a valeting and MOT section, and a showroom originally for the sale of commercial vehicles but varied during the contract to a car showroom.  This was required to be heavily glazed on the elevations facing Scotswood Road.

        There was a requirement for a large number of parking spaces within the site boundary and it was also a consideration that vehicle delivery lorries, usually articulated, would need to access the site and be able to deliver without causing disruption to the traffic using Scotswood Road.`,

        The factory extension is designed to complement the mass and character of the existing unit whilst using similar materials. The office extension is designed using clear crisp lines with full height glazing and rainscreen cladding. The existing brick built office block was refurbished externally using rainscreen cladding to match the extension in the company’s corporate colours. All the existing glazing units were replaced using powder coated glazed curtain walling to match the extension. Internally, imported Italian floor tiles throughout and the installation of a new suspended ceiling have enabled two separate buildings to be amalgamated successfully both from an internal and external appearance, which created a modern building as well as a comfortable working environment.

        The development required the demolition of a former industrial building to create this exclusive, riverfront development situated on the banks of the River Tees and offering extensive views of the surrounding countryside. 
        <br /><br />
        It was important that the architectural features from the surrounding Conservation Area were acknowledged and the size and scale of nearby buildings were complemented. Traditional materials such as random stone walls, timber sash windows, natural stone surrounds and reclaimed natural slate were used throughout the development.
         The new build units range from two storey housing to four storey town houses using a combination of seven house types. 
        <br /><br />
        The listed building conversion has been carefully restored and sympathetically treated whilst enabling the client to maximise the potential of the building. Architectural features were retained or reinstated in order to maintain the integrity of this historic building located in the heart of a Conservation Area. The conversion consists of three separate dwellings with three/ four bedrooms to the ground floor with an open plan living area to the lower ground floor. The location of the listed building takes full advantage of the picturesque views overlooking the adjacent River Tees

        As consultants to the project our brief was to obtain Building Regulations Approval for bespoke apartments the designs of which were provided by the client. The site itself is a part of a master planned area that is undergoing significant development. The development of Bowesfield aims to create a riverside community of vibrant diversity. It aspires to be a living, working and leisure environment that works as a self supporting community.
          <br /><br />
          The open plan two bedroom apartments are within four storey buildings in three separate blocks, constructed in three phases. A total of sixty eight apartments were created and constructed using timber frame technology for the superstructure. The design of the blocks, external gallery walkways and the use of prefabricated timber cassettes, complying with NHBC requirements, made this an interesting and challenging project.

        The site comprised an existing dwelling with an unused area of land adjacent to Princes Street, Bishop Auckland.  The existing dwelling was unoccupied and in a dangerous structural condition. The project required the demolition of the existing building together with a rear boundary wall to allow the construction of 7no. apartments and a new retaining wall. The compact site had to be fully maximised in order to make the scheme financially viable for the client.  
<br /><br />
        The design of the proposed building reflects that of the existing adjacent Victorian terrace, with many features such as the bay windows, stone heads and cills as well as brick detailing incorporated into the proposed design. It was important that the building did not appear as one mass; therefore, there are three steps in the roof line to ensure the stepped character of the street is maintained. 
        <br /><br />
        The new building has two storeys with habitable spaces within the pitched roof accommodating five spacious single bedroom apartments with open plan living areas and two apartments with two bedrooms.

        Previously a bathroom showroom, this property, which is Grade II Listed, has been restored and converted to provide residential apartments with a small retail unit. Opportunity was taken to also develop further apartments via an extension and linked new build to the rear, enjoying private gardens, in a location close to the centre of the City of Durham.

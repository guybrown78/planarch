The scheme comprises a purpose built vehicle body repair shop fitted with anchored jigs and paint spray booths, a valeting and MOT section, and a showroom originally for the sale of commercial vehicles but varied during the contract to a car showroom.  This was required to be heavily glazed on the elevations facing Scotswood Road.

        There was a requirement for a large number of parking spaces within the site boundary and it was also a consideration that vehicle delivery lorries, usually articulated, would need to access the site and be able to deliver without causing disruption to the traffic using Scotswood Road.`,

        The factory extension is designed to complement the mass and character of the existing unit whilst using similar materials. The office extension is designed using clear crisp lines with full height glazing and rainscreen cladding. The existing brick built office block was refurbished externally using rainscreen cladding to match the extension in the company’s corporate colours. All the existing glazing units were replaced using powder coated glazed curtain walling to match the extension. Internally, imported Italian floor tiles throughout and the installation of a new suspended ceiling have enabled two separate buildings to be amalgamated successfully both from an internal and external appearance, which created a modern building as well as a comfortable working environment.

        It was important that the architectural features from the surrounding Conservation Area were acknowledged and the size and scale of nearby buildings were complemented. Traditional materials such as random stone walls, timber sash windows, natural stone surrounds and reclaimed natural slate were used throughout the development.

        The listed building conversion has been carefully restored and sympathetically treated whilst enabling the client to maximise the potential of the building. Architectural features were retained or reinstated in order to maintain the integrity of this historic building located in the heart of a Conservation Area. The conversion consists of three separate dwellings with three/ four bedrooms to the ground floor with an open plan living area to the lower ground floor.

        This housing development of eleven detached dwelling houses on land at Willow Bridge, Letch Lane, Carlton, Stockton-on-Tees is situated on what was a brownfield site of approximately 1.6 acres previously occupied by industrial/commercial buildings.
        <br /><br />
        The buildings are designed over two stories plus the roof space using a variation of five house types. Early consultation with the planning authority and a landscape architect achieved a landscape design which complements the functional requirements of the development, whilst also providing a suitable landscaped buffer zone to the adjacent commercial buildings. External materials comprise a mixture of render, traditional hand made style brick and art stone features.

        As consultants to the project our brief was to obtain Building Regulations Approval for bespoke apartments the designs of which were provided by the client. The site itself is a part of a master planned area that is undergoing significant development. The development of Bowesfield aims to create a riverside community of vibrant diversity. It aspires to be a living, working and leisure environment that works as a self supporting community.

          The open plan two bedroom apartments are within four storey buildings in three separate blocks, constructed in three phases. A total of sixty eight apartments were created and constructed using timber frame technology for the superstructure. The design of the blocks, external gallery walkways and the use of prefabricated timber cassettes, complying with NHBC requirements, made this an interesting and challenging project.

        The site comprised an existing dwelling with an unused area of land adjacent to Princes Street, Bishop Auckland.  The existing dwelling was unoccupied and in a dangerous structural condition. The project required the demolition of the existing building together with a rear boundary wall to allow the construction of 7no. apartments and a new retaining wall. The compact site had to be fully maximised in order to make the scheme financially viable for the client.  
<br /><br />
        The design of the proposed building reflects that of the existing adjacent Victorian terrace, with many features such as the bay windows, stone heads and cills as well as brick detailing incorporated into the proposed design. It was important that the building did not appear as one mass; therefore, there are three steps in the roof line to ensure the stepped character of the street is maintained. 
        <br /><br />
        The new building has two storeys with habitable spaces within the pitched roof accommodating five spacious single bedroom apartments with open plan living areas and two apartments with two bedrooms.

        The client’s first instruction was to develop a concept based on house styles in the South of France and Florida, and an early decision was made to create a design with the Art Deco movement in mind.
        <br /><br />
        The client had specific the requirements for the house and it was determined that the five bedrooms were to be suites with dressing areas, seating and en-suite facilities. Three suites were required for his children along with a guest suite for visitors. The final and largest suite was required for the client and ultimately this became a penthouse suite. All suites were to have balconies.
        <br /><br />
        General living accommodation was to comprise a large lounge and a large kitchen with its own dining area. It was important to the client that the kitchen was large enough to be a communal area for the family to gather at mornings and evenings when all the family members were together. A large lobby area, laundry room, utility and a lift to all floors as well as a feature staircase would also be required. A large area of the dwelling was to be given over to an entertainment suite. This was to have a swimming pool, changing facilities, sauna, seating area, gymnasium equipment, bar, dance floor and cinema screen. Externally there were to be three double garages, a badminton court and extensive landscaped gardens.

        This former site of garaging has been transformed into a new, attractive 4 bedroomed dwelling. The derelict garages were demolished and the site boundary walls rebuilt to create an open site on which to build.

        The new dwelling is in a Conservation Area and pre application discussions with the Durham County Conservation Officer took place to determine an acceptable design for all concerned.

        The property is constructed from natural stonework with dressed surrounds to windows and doors. A blue slate roof with water table feature gives a sympathetic structure which assimilates well with the existing adjacent dwellings.

        The new windows are upvc manufactured to a very high standard. Sliding sash in design, they were approved by the planning department despite being in the Conservation Area where upvc is often resisted.

        The new dwelling has been constructed by a local builder who clearly takes great pride in his work. The constraints offered by this infill site have been overcome and the result is a house of character which meets client’s requirements whilst also being an asset in the Conservation Area.

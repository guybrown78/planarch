        "text": `The development is on land adjacent to Scotswood Road in Newcastle upon Tyne and was for a major retailer of motor vehicles. The scheme comprises a purpose built vehicle body repair shop fitted with anchored jigs and paint spray booths, a valeting and MOT section, and a showroom originally for the sale of commercial vehicles but varied during the contract to a car showroom.  This was required to be heavily glazed on the elevations facing Scotswood Road.
        <br /><br />
        There was a requirement for a large number of parking spaces within the site boundary and it was also a consideration that vehicle delivery lorries, usually articulated, would need to access the site and be able to deliver without causing disruption to the traffic using Scotswood Road.`,

        Our brief was for the refurbishment of existing offices as well as to extend the office block and factory unit. The site is approximately 4.8 acres with an additional 3250m2 of new factory floor space and new office space being created. All external works and surfaces were also included as part of the project.
        <br /><br />
        The factory extension is designed to complement the mass and character of the existing unit whilst using similar materials. The office extension is designed using clear crisp lines with full height glazing and rainscreen cladding. The existing brick built office block was refurbished externally using rainscreen cladding to match the extension in the company’s corporate colours. All the existing glazing units were replaced using powder coated glazed curtain walling to match the extension. Internally, imported Italian floor tiles throughout and the installation of a new suspended ceiling have enabled two separate buildings to be amalgamated successfully both from an internal and external appearance, which created a modern building as well as a comfortable working environment.

        Due to expansion and the introduction of a new product line, the client required a new factory unit on vacant land within the company’s site boundary.

        This new building houses a number of production lines, a new office block and has facilities for delivery and collection points for articulated vehicles as well as storage for trailers. 
        <br /><br />
        The building provided an opportunity for the client to showcase the company’s own products of profiled steel sheeting, including an innovative new panel which allowed the collection of solar heat which is then used to heat the building itself.

          The client is an established name in the car sales industry and who demanded a building design which would be seen as a flagship development. 
          <br /><br />
          The site is approximately 1.5 acres and the proposal creates 2200m2 of internal floor space to the ground floor. The construction of this two storey car showroom was originally designed to include two franchises. However, the building was then increased in size at the request of the client in order to create sufficient floor space for three separate franchises. The building also includes a workshop area and offices to both ground and first floors. 
          <br /><br />
          The building is designed with clear crisp lines which create a sculptural aesthetically-pleasing building. The external materials also enhance the modern design by using smooth silver metallic wall and roof systems. The large areas of curtain walling and internal double height spaces further assist in creating this dynamically shaped and contemporary building.

        This housing development of eleven detached dwelling houses on land at Willow Bridge, Letch Lane, Carlton, Stockton-on-Tees is situated on what was a brownfield site of approximately 1.6 acres previously occupied by industrial/commercial buildings.
        <br /><br />
        The buildings are designed over two stories plus the roof space using a variation of five house types. Early consultation with the planning authority and a landscape architect achieved a landscape design which complements the functional requirements of the development, whilst also providing a suitable landscaped buffer zone to the adjacent commercial buildings. External materials comprise a mixture of render, traditional hand made style brick and art stone features.

        As consultants to the project our brief was to obtain Building Regulations Approval for bespoke apartments the designs of which were provided by the client. The site itself is a part of a master planned area that is undergoing significant development. The development of Bowesfield aims to create a riverside community of vibrant diversity. It aspires to be a living, working and leisure environment that works as a self supporting community.
          <br /><br />
          The open plan two bedroom apartments are within four storey buildings in three separate blocks, constructed in three phases. A total of sixty eight apartments were created and constructed using timber frame technology for the superstructure. The design of the blocks, external gallery walkways and the use of prefabricated timber cassettes, complying with NHBC requirements, made this an interesting and challenging project.
